Healthcare Analysis
Project Objective
Analyze patient admissions across multiple hospitals to identify trends, common medical conditions, and areas requiring operational improvements. The goal is to provide actionable insights to help hospitals manage patient load efficiently.

Key Findings
Most hospitals have a small number of admissions, while a few hospitals handle the majority of patients, including a high share of emergency cases.
Arthritis is the most common medical condition among admitted patients; other conditions account for significantly fewer cases.
Elective admissions constitute the largest share of total cases, highlighting the high demand for urgent and planned care services.
Patient admissions vary month to month, with noticeable spikes and drops, indicating potential seasonal trends.

Recommendations
Hospitals should ensure adequate staffing and resources during peak periods to manage emergency and elective admissions efficiently.
Seasonal trends should be monitored to anticipate high-demand periods, ensuring proper allocation of beds, equipment, and medical staff.
